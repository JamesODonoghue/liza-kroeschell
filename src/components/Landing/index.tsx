                            "The 5-6 year olds at our public school in San
                            Francisco absolutely cherished our dance classes
                            with Ms. Liza. She created a fun environment for
                            students to actively engage and express themselves.
                            So many smiles and an energy of pure joy filled the
                            room. She taught children how to count beats and
                            listen to music, too. The children worked solo and
                            often times with a partner. These two approaches
                            gave the children the opportunity to be brave on
                            their own as well as cooperative with others. I can
                            honestly say, the children made several new friends
                            in the dance class"

                                recreational dance education. Ms. Nagata's way
                                of inspiring excellence in her students inspired
                                Liza to co-author an essay with Ms. Nagata about
                                her teaching methods, which was published in
