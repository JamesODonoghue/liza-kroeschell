                        "The 5-6 year olds at our public school in San Francisco
                        absolutely cherished our dance classes with Ms. Liza.
                        She created a fun environment for students to actively
                        engage and express themselves. So many smiles and an
                        energy of pure joy filled the room.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She taught children how to count beats and listen to
                        music, too. The children worked solo and often times
                        with a partner. These two approaches gave the children
                        the opportunity to be brave on their own as well as
                        cooperative with others.

                    <p>
                        I can honestly say, the children made several new
                        friends in the dance class"

                        <h2>Creativity</h2>
                        <p>
                            Ms. Liza believes that a clear sense of structure
                            and safety creates a solid foundation from which
                            creative exploration flourishes. When children feel
                            safe and supported, they are able to take risks and
                            push themselves to try new things.

                            By moving their bodies big and taking up space,
                            children practice a sense of self-confidence and
                            belief in themselves that transfers to their lives
