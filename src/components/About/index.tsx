                        Liza discovered a passion for teaching in 2012 while
                        training under Ms. Corrine Nagata of Nagata Dance, an
                        organization that partners with San Francisco elementary
                        schools to provide recreational dance education.

                    <p>
                        Ms. Nagata's way of inspiring excellence in her students
                        inspired Liza to co-author an essay with Ms. Nagata
                        about her teaching methods, which was published in 2017
                        as the final chapter of the book, Dance Pedagogy for a
                        Diverse World: Culturally Relevant Theory, Research, and
                        Practice.
