                        Liza discovered a passion for teaching in 2012 while training under Ms. Corrine Nagata of Nagata
                        Dance, an organization that partners with San Francisco elementary schools to provide
                        recreational dance education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ms. Nagata's way of inspiring excellence in her students inspired Liza to co-author an essay
                        with Ms. Nagata about her teaching methods, which was published in 2017 as the final chapter of
                        the book, Dance Pedagogy for a Diverse World: Culturally Relevant Theory, Research, and
                        Practice.
