                    "The 5-6 year olds at our public school in San Francisco
                    absolutely cherished our dance classes with Ms. Liza. She
                    created a fun environment for students to actively engage
                    and express themselves. So many smiles and an energy of pure
                    joy filled the room.

                    She taught children how to count beats and listen to music,
                    too. The children worked solo and often times with a
                    partner. These two approaches gave the children the
                    opportunity to be brave on their own as well as cooperative
                    with others.

                <p>
                    I can honestly say, the children made several new friends in
                    the dance class"
