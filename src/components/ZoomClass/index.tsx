                Today's 10am dance class has been cancelled in observance of the
                Dance Industry Blackout.
            </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            The blackout calls for the dance industry to stop operations on
            Tuesday, June 2, to bring awareness to the police brutality and
            racial injustice in the U.S. Class will resume Thursday,{" "}

        <p>
            Many of our country's most popular dances--jazz, tap, hip hop, the
            twist!--started in the black community. This isn't something we
            always talk about when we're dancing, but black art and
            contributions from the black community have shaped the dance steps
            that we learn today. Instead of class today, watch this video and
            dance along!
        </p>
        <p>
            Thank you all so much for your support. I look forward to dancing
            with you again on Thursday! Best, Ms. Liza
